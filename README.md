# GB (Z80) Emulator
Creating a Z80 Emulator from scratch in C with the ultimate goal of running Pokemon Red and eventually full emulation. Will flesh out README as progress comes along.

## Dependencies

To build and run the emulator, you will need the following dependencies:

- CMake (version 3.0 or higher)
- CUnit (version 2.1-3)

## Getting Started

To build:

```bash
$cmake ..
$make
```
Running the test suite:
```bash
$cd build
$./z80_tests
```
